<h1 align="center">Lana Del Rey ft. The Weeknd - Blog Card Layout</h1>

Blog created only with HTML and CSS, inspired by <a href="https://codepen.io/HenrikFricke/pen/GRNYrXK">this layout here</a> and everything here was done while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP4eqhWc7sI">Lust for Life</a> was playing, can you tell? So, this is my first project done since the beginning without a tutorial, I'm very proud. It still has some problems, it's not responsive, when I do I'll post more updates, but all this journey, you can follow in this general <a href="https://github.com/ahristudies/100days-ofcode">repository of the 100 days of code challenge</a>.
